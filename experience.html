<center><h3> <p style="background-color:lightskyblue;">In 2019, while waiting for my SPM's result, i do work at many places as a part-timer. I get started with a small kiosk of seliing baby clothes and shoes. There, I was paid RM 50 per day and i work every Monday to Friday every week. I got lots of knowledge and experiences from there. I learnt on how to serve customers right, I also learnt on how to do some basic calculations in giving changes to my customers. My boss is also one of the best  boss I have ever had. She always understands me and always gives me extra payment if the sales increased. She also treat her staff really well and sometimes give us free food and drinks. I do enjoy work with her and I hope that I can work with her in the future. </p></h3></center>

    <center><h3> <p style="background-color: plum;">In 2022, after finishing my 3rd semester, I do complete my internship at Perpustakaan Tun Abdul Razak (PTAR) with my other three friends. We started our intern at 28th February until 8th April 2022 in PTAR library under the guide of Puan Norazlin bt Yusof. We learnt so many things about our course here. The way librarian arrange the books based on the call number, the way they bind the books, the way they treat users at Service center, and many more. Every morning, at 8.00 am till 8.30 am, we will go shelving books at floor 5. From there, we learnt that the books were arranged by their call number, not by their size. The officers there also very nice and kind. They always help us in every work that we done. They also explained us about things that we dont know very well. The environment of working there made us feel welcomed and felt inspired to be one of the officers there.    </mark></p></h3></center>
